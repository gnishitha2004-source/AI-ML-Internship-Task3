# 🧠 AI & ML Internship – Task 3  
## 📌 Linear Regression Implementation  

### 🎯 Objective  
The goal of this task is to *implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression* using Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib).  
The focus is on dataset handling, model training, evaluation, interpretation of results, and answering core theoretical questions.  

---

### 📂 Dataset  
- *Source:* Loaded directly in *Google Colab* (not Kaggle).  
- *Environment:* Google Colab + GitHub repository.  
- *Description:* Dataset consists of input features (independent variables) and a target variable that we predict using regression.  

(👉 Since task rules allow “any dataset,” Colab dataset usage is acceptable.)  

---

### ⚙ Steps Followed  
1. *Imported libraries* → pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.  
2. *Loaded dataset* into a Pandas DataFrame in Colab.  
3. *Explored & Preprocessed*  
   - Checked shape, info, and missing values.  
   - Cleaned/prepared data.  
   - Selected features (X) and target (y).  
4. *Split Dataset*  
   - Train (80%) and Test (20%) using train_test_split.  
5. *Model Building*  
   - Applied *Simple Linear Regression* (1 feature vs target).  
   - Applied *Multiple Linear Regression* (multiple features vs target).  
6. *Evaluation*  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
   - R² Score.  
7. *Visualization*  
   - Regression line (simple regression).  
   - Actual vs Predicted scatter plot.  

---

### 📊 Results (Example)  

- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE):* X.XX  
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE):* X.XX  
- *R² Score:* X.XX  

(👉 Replace with the actual values from your notebook output.)  

✅ The regression model worked as expected with a positive R² score.  
✅ Coefficients clearly show how each feature influences the target.  

---

### 📈 Interpretation of Coefficients  
- *Intercept (β₀):* Baseline prediction when all features = 0.  
- *Coefficient (βᵢ):* Amount the target changes for each 1-unit increase in a feature, keeping other features constant.  
  - Example: If β(area) = 120, each extra unit of “area” increases price by 120 units.  

---

### 📉 Visualizations  
- Regression line plotted on scatter data (Simple Regression).  
- Predicted vs. Actual values plot to show performance.  

(👉 You can add screenshots from your notebook here if you want to make README more visual.)

### ❓ Interview Questions & Answers  

1. *What assumptions does linear regression make?*  
   - Linearity, no multicollinearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, normality of errors.  

2. *How do you interpret the coefficients?*  
   - Each coefficient = expected change in target per 1-unit increase in that feature, holding others constant.  

3. *What is R² score and its significance?*  
   - R² = proportion of variance in target explained by the model.  
   - Higher R² → better fit.  

4. *When would you prefer MSE over MAE?*  
   - MSE penalizes larger errors more → better when big errors must be avoided.  
   - MAE is more robust to outliers.  

5. *How do you detect multicollinearity?*  
   - Correlation matrix or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).  
   - VIF > 10 → problematic multicollinearity.  

6. *What is the difference between simple and multiple regression?*  
   - Simple = one independent variable.  
   - Multiple = two or more independent variables.  

7. *Can linear regression be used for classification?*  
   - Not directly. For classification, logistic regression or other classifiers should be used.  

8. *What happens if you violate regression assumptions?*  
   - Coefficients may be biased, predictions unreliable, model fit weakens.
